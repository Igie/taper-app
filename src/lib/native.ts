/**
 * SOL, which is not a token.
 *
 * A pool holds token accounts, so the SOL side of any pair is really the
 * native mint `So111…112` wrapped into an SPL account. Nothing in the program
 * knows about that — to `taper-amm` wrapped SOL is an ordinary mint — so the
 * whole of the difference is here, and it is three instructions:
 *
 * - **before**, an idempotent ATA create, a lamport transfer into it, and
 *   `sync_native` so the account's `amount` matches the lamports it now holds;
 * - **after**, a close, which pays the whole balance back out as SOL.
 *
 * The wrapped account is therefore treated as scratch space: it is funded for
 * exactly one transaction and emptied at the end of it, so a user is never
 * left holding a wSOL balance they have to notice. The cost of that choice is
 * that a wSOL balance held deliberately is swept back to SOL too; the panels
 * say so rather than hiding it.
 *
 * `SOL_RESERVE` is the other half of the same idea: wrapping every lamport a
 * wallet holds leaves nothing to pay the fee with, so the max button stops
 * short of the balance rather than producing a transaction that cannot land.
